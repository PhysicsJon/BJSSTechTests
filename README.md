# BJSSTechTests

To be used for running technical portions of the BJSS Automated Test Engineer (or similar) interviews.

The dotnet example is fully self contained, you just need to ensure you have the repo and a suitable IDE (Visual Studio recommended).

The java example relies on the WebApp in the dotnet example, instructions are provided in the readme within the java example to make this simple

If you wish to run the technical test remotely follow the instructions on [Codespaces](codespaces.md)
